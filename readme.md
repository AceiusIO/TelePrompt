TelePrompt
===========
![Contributor Counter](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/AceiusIO/TelePrompt)

TelePrompt will be a free (as in freedom), open source teleprompter app with a native recording feature.
You'll be able to enter your speech, record it, and send it to friends!
Currently we are building to mobile with [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org).
Seriously, don't just build the source code you're self to avoid buying a copy. Then I will be sad :(
